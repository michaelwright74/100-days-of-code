# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Michael Wright

### Day 1: October 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started learning JavaScript using the resources I mention in my Medium post. Created 2 small scripts extending a couple of exercises from the courses.

I also installed and used Git for the first time and in the process completed the Hacktoberfest challenge.

Published a Medium post with more info.

**Thoughts:** Although I've only scratched the surface of the basics of JS I'm surprised how well I'm taking it in. Hope this continues ;)

**Goals for Tomorrow:**
1. Complete more Codecademy & freeCodeCamp lessons.
2. Watch more Javascript videos from the courses.
3. Create some more pens.
4. Publish another Medium post.
