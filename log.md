# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Michael Wright

## Days 5 & 6: October 30 & 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
1. **Codecademy** - Completed the following modules from Introduction to Javascript: Arrays, Loops and Iterators.
2. **Scotch.io - Getting Started with JavaScript** - Completed lesson 8.
3. **The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy Course** - Completed the Javascript Basics - Arrays Module.
4. **freeCodeCamp** - Completed a further 38 exercises in the Basic Javascript Module.
5. **The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 (Udemy)** - Completed the videos on Arrays, If Statements and Loops.

**Thoughts** Lot's more working through videos and exercises done. Am looking forward to getting to the stage where I learn about working with the DOM so I can build some proper things rather than just working with alert and console.log. Everything still going Okay though.

## Days 3 & 4: October 28 & 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
1. **freeCodeCamp** - Completed the first 40 exercises of the Basic Javascript Module. Note: I plan to leave the jQuery module until I have learned more Javascript.
2. **Codecademy** - Completed the following modules from Introduction to Javascript: Variables, Control Flow, Functions and Scope.
3. **Sololearn** - Completed the Conditionals & Loops and Functions modules of the Javascript Tutorial. Also completed the whole of HTML Fundamentals.
4. **The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy Course** - Completed the Javascript Basics - Functions Module.

**Thoughts:** Been feeling pretty under the weather this weekend but kept learning more Javascript. Things are definitely getting more complex the further into the courses I go. I think I've got the fundamentals of functions down now though but it's been hard going. Early finish to Day 4 (Sunday) and back to it tomorrow hopefully feeling refreshed and raring to go.

## Day 2: October 27, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
1. **freeCodeCamp** - Did 12 exercises finishing the Bootstrap section.
2. **Codecademy** - Completed Introduction to Javascript: Introduction to Javascript, Learn Git: Basic Git Workflow & Learn Git: How to Backtrack in Git.
3. **GitHub** - Forked the 100-days-of-code repo and started this log.
4. **Sololearn** - Joined and completed the Overview & Basic Concepts modules of the Javascript Tutorial.
5. **Scotch.io - Getting Started with JavaScript** - Completed the first 7 lessons.
6. **The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy Course** - Completed the Javascript Basics - Control Flow Module.

**Thoughts:** It's 11:20pm and it's been a long day of learning. Maybe using so many sources is slowing me down but I feel it's helping me understand things a lot more fully. Most of what I've learned today has been focused around loops in Javascript and I feel I've got a decent understanding of them to take forward.

I'm finding the scotch.io course to be a lot more fast moving than the others and so far it's the only one that has mentioned ES6. The main takeaway on that so far is using *const* or *let* instead of *var* to declare a variable.

All in all it's been a tiring but I feel productive day.

## Day 1: October 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started learning JavaScript using the resources I mention in my Medium post. Created 2 small scripts extending a couple of exercises from the courses.

I also installed and used Git for the first time and in the process completed the Hacktoberfest challenge.

Published a Medium post with more info.

**Thoughts:** Although I've only scratched the surface of the basics of JS I'm surprised how well I'm taking it in. Hope this continues ;)
